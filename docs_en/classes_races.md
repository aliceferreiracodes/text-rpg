# Races and Classes

In the world of Tiriad, every journey begins with a choice. One's race and class define their identity, abilities, and role in the adventure. Whether you draw strength from ancient bloodlines or master the art of combat, magic, or furtiveness, these choices will shape your path. 

Each race offers unique traits, inclinations and cultural backgrounds, while every class unlocks distinct powers and playstyles. Together, they form the foundation of your story, empowering you to face the challenges that lie ahead.


## Races

### Humans

Humans are the most ambitious of the races. Empathetic, charismatic, and excellent at collaboration, they have founded great cities and developed impressive technologies. Their curiosity and determination drive them forward, but their short lifespans leave little time for deep reflection compared to elves or dwarves.

### Elves

Elves are tall, agile, and deeply connected to nature. Despite more frail than humans and dwarves, their grace and dexterity make them swift and skilled, particularly in wilderness settings. With their long lifespans, they spend much time in meditation and contemplation. Though clever, they often lack the charisma of humans.

### Dwarves

Dwarves are a hardy, ancient race, possibly older than elves. Masters of smithing, stonework, and weapon crafting, they excel underground and in close contact with the earth. Stubborn and impulsive, they often clash with elves. Though short in stature, dwarves are incredibly strong, but less suited to acrobatics or complex reasoning.

## Classes

### Bard

Bards are versatile performers and storytellers, wielding music, poetry, and charm as tools of magic and influence. Their talents inspire allies, confuse enemies, and turn the tide of battle with a well-placed melody or tale. While not as tough as fighters, bards thrive on creativity, charisma, and quick thinking.

### Rogue

Rogues are masters of stealth and precision, striking from the shadows when least expected. Agile and resourceful, they excel at infiltration, traps, and surprise attacks. Though not heavily armored, rogues compensate with cunning, speed, and a sinister ability to escape even the direst situations.

### Wizard

Wizards are scholars of the arcane, wielding immense magical power through years of study and practice. Though physically fragile and reliant on their spellbooks, their knowledge grants them unmatched versatility. A single spell, cast at the right moment, can obliterate foes or alter reality itself.

### Fighter

Fighters are the backbone of any battlefield, skilled in weaponry and combat tactics. Tough, disciplined, and adaptable, they can endure harsh conditions and face enemies head-on. Whether wielding a sword, axe, or shield, fighters rely on strength, stamina, and determination to triumph.
