# Abilities, Skills and Stats

Understanding **Abilities**, **Skills**, and **Stats** is crucial for creating characters and grasping the core mechanics of this RPG. These components determine how actions unfold, whether they succeed or fail, and represent a character's current state.

This section also explains how the three races—Humans, Elves, and Dwarves—and the four classes—Bard, Rogue, Wizard, and Fighter—affect a character's Abilities, Skills, and Stats.


## Abilities 

In this RPG, **Abilities** represent a character's mental, physical, and magical attributes. The seven Abilities are:

-   **Strength**: Measures physical power.
    
-   **Dexterity**: Measures agility and quickness.
    
-   **Constitution**: Measures endurance and resilience.
    
-   **Intelligence**: Measures reasoning, memory, and knowledge.
    
-   **Wisdom**: Measures perception, insight, and judgment.
    
-   **Magic**: Measures affinity with magic.

- **Charisma:** Measures the ability to influence and inspire others.

Each Ability has an **Ability Point** value and an **Ability Bonus**. These are determined by the character's race and class. Let's use the **Human** race and the **Fighter** class as examples:
  
| Abilities (Human) | Ability Bonus |
|--|--|
| Strength  | 0 |
| Dexterity | 0 |
| Constitution | 0 |
| Intelligence  | 0 |
| Wisdom | -1 |
| Magic | 0 |
| Charisma | +1 |
<br>

| Abilities (Fighter) | Ability Bonus |
|--|--|
| Strength  | +1 |
| Dexterity | 0 |
| Constitution | 0 |
| Intelligence  | 0 |
| Wisdom | -1 |
| Magic | 0 |
| Charisma | 0 | 

### Example: Joana, a Human Fighter

Joana's **Ability Bonus** is calculated by adding the bonuses from her race and class.

|Joana's Abilities| Ability Bonus|
|--|--|
| Strength  | +1 |
| Dexterity | 0 |
| Constitution | 0 |
| Intelligence  | 0 |
| Wisdom | -2 |
| Magic | 0 |
| Charisma | +1 |


#### Assigning Ability Points

Players distribute **5 Ability Points** as they like. The **total Ability Points** are then calculated by adding the **Ability Bonus** to the distributed values.

For example, if Joana's player assigns points as follows:

-   **Strength**: +1
    
-   **Dexterity**: +2
    
-   **Constitution**: +1
    
-   **Intelligence**: +1
    

Her total Ability Points are:

|Joana's Abilities| Distributed Points| Ability Bonus | Ability Points
|--|--|--|--|
| Strength  | +1 | +1 | +2 |
| Dexterity | +2 | 0 | +2 |
| Constitution | +1 | 0 | +1 |
| Intelligence  | +1 | 0 | +1 |
| Wisdom | 0 | -2 | -2 |
| Magic | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Charisma | 0 | +1 | +1 |

**Note**: Ability Points and Ability Bonus serve different purposes. Bonuses reflect racial and class influence, while points are player-assigned. The Ability Bonus also has a few other purposes as we'll see later.


## Skills

**Skills** are specific capabilities derived from Abilities. Each Skill is tied to an Ability and determines success rate in related actions. There are 21 Skills:

-   **Strength**:
    
    -   Athletics
        
-   **Dexterity**:
    
    -   Acrobatics, Stealth, Theft
        
-   **Intelligence**:
    
    -   Crafting, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Science
        
-   **Magic**:
    
    -   Brewing, Spells, Magical Botany, Magical Equipment
        
-   **Wisdom**:
    
    -   Animal Handling, Perspicacity, Perception, Survival
        
-   **Charisma**:
    
    -   Charm, Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion
        

### Example: Joana’s Skills

Initially, each Skill inherits its Ability’s total points:

| Joana's Skill | Skill Points | 
| --- | --- |
| Acrobatics *(Dex)* | +2
| Animal Handling *(Wis)* | - 2
| Athletics *(Str)* | +2
| Brewing *(Mag)* | 0
| Charm *(Char)* |  +1
| Crafting *(Int)* | +1
| Deception *(Char)* | +1
| Intimidation *(Char)* | +1
| Investigation *(Int)* | +1
| Magical Botany *(Mag)* | 0
| Magical Equipment *(Mag)* | 0
| Medicine *(Int)* | +1
| Nature *(Int)* | +1
| Perception *(Wis)* | - 2
| Perspicacity *(Wis)* | - 2
| Persuasion *(Char)* | +1
| Science *(Int)* | +1
| Spells *(Mag)* | 0
| Stealth *(Dex)* | +2
| Survival *(Wis)* | - 2
| Theft *(Dex)* | +2

#### Distributing Skill Points

Players allocate **15 additional points** among Skills. For example:
    
-   Animal Handling: +2
-   Athletics: +2
-   Charm +1
-   Crafting+1
-   Intimidation: +2
-  Magical Equipment +1
-   Medicine: +2
-  Perception: +2
- Survival: +2 

Joana’s final Skill table is:

| Joana's Skill | Skill Points | 
| --- | --- |
| Acrobatics *(Dex)* | +2
| Animal Handling *(Wis)* | 0
| Athletics *(Str)* | +4
| Brewing *(Mag)* | 0
| Charm *(Char)* |  +2
| Crafting *(Int)* | +2
| Deception *(Char)* | +1
| Intimidation *(Char)* | +3
| Investigation *(Int)* | +1
| Magical Botany *(Mag)* | 0
| Magical Equipment *(Mag)* | +1
| Medicine *(Int)* | +3
| Nature *(Int)* | +1
| Perception *(Wis)* | 0
| Perspicacity *(Wis)* | - 2
| Persuasion *(Char)* | +1
| Science *(Int)* | +1
| Spells *(Mag)* | 0
| Stealth *(Dex)* | +2
| Survival *(Wis)* | 0
| Theft *(Dex)* | +2

### Skill Level and Skill Expertise

Every skill also has a **Skill Level** and the respective **Skill Expertise**. Characters start at Level 1 in every skill, and gain Skill Experience whenever they succeed using each of them, eventually leveling up. The Skill Expertise is based on a skill's level:
 
| Skill Level | Skill Expertise |
|--|--|
| 1 - 4 | Not Skilled |
| 5 - 14 | Half Skilled |
| 15 - 24 | Skilled |
| 25 - 34 | Expert |
| 35 - 50 (max) | Master |


## Stats

**Stats** represent the current state of a character. There are 7 Stats:

-   **Health Points (HP)**: Physical health.
    
-   **Magic Meter (MM)**: Magical energy.
    
-   **Stamina**: Physical energy.
    
-   **Luck**: Affects success rates.
    
-   **Speed**: Movement speed (varies by race). Varies depending on circumstances or effects the character may be under.
    
-   **Perception**: Awareness and lucidity (not to be confused with the Perception Skill). Varies depending on circumstances or effects the character may be under.
    
-   **Reputation**: Social standing.

### Health Points (HP), Stamina and Magic Meter (MM)

The maximum HP and Stamina are determined based on the character's Constitution Bonus, and the maximum MM on the Magic Bonus:

$$Max\ HP = 50 + (Constitution\ Bonus × 10)$$
$$Max\ MM = 50 + (Magic\ Bonus × 10)$$
$$Max\ Stamina = 50 + (Constitution\ Bonus × 10)$$

For Joana:

**Constitution Bonus = 0** <br>
**Magic Bonus = 0**

$$50 + (0×10) = 50$$

| Stat | Max Value |
|--|--|
| HP | 50 |
| MM | 50 |
| Stamina | 50 |


### Speed

The maximum Speed is determined based on the character's Dexterity Bonus and a base value, that depends on the character's race:

-   Humans: 10
    
-   Elves: 11
    
-   Dwarves: 9

$$Max\ Speed=Base+Dexterity\ Bonus$$

For Joana:

**Dexterity Bonus = 0**

$$10 + 0 = 10$$

| Stat | Max Value |
|--|--|
| Speed | 10 |

### Luck, Perception and Reputation

The maximum Luck, Perception and Reputation of a character is always **100**, for all levels, classes and races.
