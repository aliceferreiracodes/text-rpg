# üó°Ô∏è Tiriad's Quest

Tiriad's Quest is a text-based RPG made using Python.

When I'm learning something new, I always like to find practical ways to use that knowledge, and, especially in programming, practice is indispensable. But not only do I like to practice, but I also like to practice doing something FUN. 

So, as someone who really likes game development and RPGs, when I was learning Python I had a brilliant idea: why not create a text-based RPG to apply what I'm learning?

And that's how Tiriad's Quest was born.

## Progress

Tiriad's Quest is a work-in-progress that currently supports character creation. The gameplay part is under development and hopefully will soon be added! But until then, you can still create a cool RPG character.
